## Key Concepts

### Bucket

Logical container used to store objects.

### Object

A file stored inside an S3 bucket.

### Static Website Hosting

Feature that allows Amazon S3 to serve HTML, CSS and JavaScript files as a website.

### Lifecycle Rule

Automatically transitions objects between storage classes to optimize costs.
