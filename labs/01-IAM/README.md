# Overview

This laboratory introduces **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, the AWS service responsible for securely controlling authentication and authorization across AWS resources.

During this lab, a secure administrative environment was created by implementing IAM users, groups, managed policies and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), following AWS security best practices.

---

# Objectives

- Understand AWS IAM fundamentals.
- Create IAM users.
- Create IAM groups.
- Attach AWS managed policies.
- Configure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Access the AWS Management Console using IAM credentials.
