# Troubleshooting – AWS IAM

## Issue 1: Unable to access an AWS service

### Possible cause

The IAM user does not have sufficient permissions.

### Verification

Review:

- Policies attached directly to the user.
- Policies attached to the user's groups.
- Explicit deny statements.
- Permission boundaries.
- Service Control Policies, when using AWS Organizations.

### Resolution

Assign only the policy required for the task and verify that no explicit deny overrides it.

---

## Issue 2: MFA code is rejected

### Possible causes

- The device time is not synchronized.
- The incorrect MFA device was registered.
- The code expired before being submitted.

### Resolution

- Verify that the mobile device uses automatic date and time.
- Wait for a new MFA code.
- Resynchronize or replace the MFA device if necessary.

---

## Issue 3: IAM user cannot sign in to the console

### Possible causes

- Console access was not enabled.
- Incorrect account alias or account ID.
- Incorrect username or password.
- Password reset is required.

### Resolution

Verify that console access is enabled and use the correct IAM sign-in URL.

---

## Issue 4: User has AdministratorAccess but an action is denied

### Possible causes

- An explicit deny exists.
- A permission boundary limits the user.
- An AWS Organizations Service Control Policy restricts the action.
- The resource has its own restrictive resource-based policy.

### Resolution

Evaluate all applicable identity and resource policies because `AdministratorAccess` does not override an explicit deny.

---

## Security Considerations

- Never use the root account for daily work.
- Enable MFA for privileged identities.
- Avoid creating access keys unless necessary.
- Rotate or remove unused credentials.
- Review IAM permissions periodically.
- Apply the principle of least privilege.
